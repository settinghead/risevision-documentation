## What is Common Header

At the top level, Rise Vision Common Header (CH) is an AngularJS directive that inserts a customizable header into your Angular-based Rise Vision app.

RVCH is responsible for Google OAuth2 authentication, user & company management as well as UI state dependency management and provides related API interfaces for your apps.

Rise Vision Common Header works in conjunction with Rise Vision, the digital signage management application that runs on Google Cloud.

At this stage Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.
