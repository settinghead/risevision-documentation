##What it does
The Video item allows you to add video directly into your Presentation. This can be a video from Storage, your server or a 3rd party server.

##How to add it to a presentation
To put this widget on a display:

1. Add a new placeholder to a presentation.   
2. In the placeholder's Properties window, click the Add link and select Video
3. To select a video from Storage, select the Storage link to the right of the URL field.
4. To use a video hosted somewhere else, enter the the URL to that item in the URL field.

##Supported Video Format
While you are free to add a FLV, MOV or a MP4 encoded video to your Presentation using the Video Item, we only support one video format, WebM. Why? Because WebM was built for delivering video content over the web, which means it is adaptable to varying processing and bandwidth conditions, resulting in a better experience for our User, You! If youâ€™re interested in learning more about WebM take a look at the documentation on the WebM site here.

If you see issues with a video in your Presentation, and the problematic video(s) are not WebM encoded, please convert to WebM before contacting Support.
