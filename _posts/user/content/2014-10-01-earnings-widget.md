##What it does
The U.S. Earnings Calendar Widget provides a live stream of quarterly earnings announcements for NYSE and NASDAQ listed companies as they happen throughout the trading day. For each announcement, you will see analysts' consensus earnings per share and revenue estimates, as well as the company's actuals and year-over-year trends. Data for this widget is provided by [Analyst Ratings Network (ARN)](http://www.analystratings.net/). 

##How to add it to a presentation
To put this widget on a display:

1. Add a new placeholder to a presentation.   
2. In the placeholder's Properties window, click the Add link and select Content to open a new window showing the Rise Vision store.  
3. Click the widget named U.S. Earnings Calendar. This takes you to the productâ€™s description and pricing information.  
4. Click the Add button to add it to your playlist.  This closes the store window and returns you to the Placeholder window, where U.S. Earnings Calendar now appears in the placeholder's playlist.

##How to configure it
To configure this widget, click the Configure link.  If this is the only item in the placeholder's playlist, the Configure link is in the Settings area at the bottom of the Placeholder window, right below the playlist. If there are multiple items in the playlist, clicking the name of this widget opens an Item window and the Configure link is in the Settings area of that window.

Clicking the Configure link opens an Earning Announcements Settings window, in which you can configure the following settings:
####Announcements
Click the drop-down list and choose Today, Tomorrow or Yesterday to select which companies to show: those scheduled to announce their earnings today, tomorrow or yesterday.
####Markets
Click the drop-down list and select which market to show: USA, Canada, or All (which includes London).
####Columns
#####Select A Column To Add
Initially, this drop-down list is empty because by default, all of this widget's columns - Company Name, Ticker Symbol, Quarter Announced, Consensus Estimate, Actual Earnings, Consensus Revenue, and Actual Revenue - are already added.  

If you remove any column (by clicking the minus icon to the right of its name), it will be placed in the drop-down list, making it available to add again if you should decide to do so at a later date.

Removing and re-adding columns is also useful when you want to rearrange the order of the columns in the widget. To do so, first click the minus icons beside each column to remove them all.  Then click the drop-down list (which now contains the names of all of the columns) and select your desired columns one by one, in the order in which you'd like them to appear from left to right.

#####Header Text, Width & Alignment of Columns
Click the chevron (>) icon beside each column's name to reveal fields for configuring:
######Header Text
Type a custom name for the column in this field, or leave it blank to keep the default column name.
######Width
Type a custom width (in pixels) in this field, or leave it at the default width.
######Alignment
Select the desired column alignment from this drop-down field. Choices are align left, center, align right or justified.

####Scroll
Specify how the data scrolls in your table by selecting one of the following:
- No:  data will not scroll
- Continuously:  data will scroll continuously, like movie credits
- By Page:  one page of data will appear at a time, and then be replaced by the next page of data

####Scroll Speed
If the Scroll field is set to either Continuously or By Page, you can select the speed of the scroll in this field.  Choices are Slowest, Slow, Medium, Fast and Fastest.
####Scroll Pause
Specify the number of seconds that the scroll will pause when the screen is touched (for touchscreens), or when the end of the list is reached.

####Row Padding
Specify how many pixels of empty space (padding) will appear above and below the content in each row.
####Row Color
Specify the color and opacity of the rows' background. You can either use the color picker and opacity slider to specify them visually, or enter a specific rgba value in the field below the opacity slider.
####Alternate Row Color
Use this field if you would like every alternate row to have a second different color. 
####Header Format
Use this field to format the following properties of the header text: font family, font size, font style (bold, italic and/or underlined), font color and opacity, and background color and opacity.
####Data Format
Use this field to format the following properties of the data text: font family, font size, font style (bold, italic and/or underlined), font color and opacity, and background color and opacity.
####Background
Specify the color and opacity of the widget's background. You can either use the color picker and opacity slider to specify them visually, or enter a specific rgba value in the field below the opacity slider.
