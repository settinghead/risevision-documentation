In general usage, "content" can refer to any type of item that appears in a presentation, whether it's text, an image, a video, a web page or a widget.

But in the Rise Vision platform, the term “content”, as encountered when you're adding an item to a placeholder's playlist, refers most specifically to **widgets** (see definition below). When you click the Add link in a placeholder's playlist, selecting **Content** brings you to the Rise Vision store's list of available widgets.

In the same area of the platform, the term is also used to refer to items (most often, web pages) that are brought in to a presentation from the web. When you click the Add link in a placeholder's playlist, selecting **Content by URL** brings you to a window where you can specify the URL of any web page (or widget that uses the widget API) that you wish to add to the playlist.

####What is a widget?
On the web, the term "widget" refers to a specialized application that can be added to an area of a web page to perform a specific function.  Or, as Wikipedia defines it, a "small application with limited functionality that can be installed and executed within a web page by an end user."

In the Rise Vision platform, because presentations are essentially web pages built in HTML, you can use widgets to put specialized content on your displays. Examples of specialized content include data-driven information such as stock quotes, and location-specific information such as weather reports. Widgets are available from the Rise Vision store.  Some are free, and others are premium widgets that require a monthly subscription fee.
