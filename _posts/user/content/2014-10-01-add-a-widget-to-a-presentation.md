5. Browse or search the store to find the widget that you want.  To select it, click its image (which turns into an "i" icon when you move your mouse over it). This opens a new sub-window showing the details of the selected widget.
6. Click the green Add button with the + icon.  This adds the widget to your placeholder's playlist, closes the store window and returns you to the placeholder properties window.
