While you are free to add a FLV, MOV or a MP4 encoded video to your Presentation using the Video Item, we only support one video format, WebM. Why? Because WebM was built for delivering video content over the web, which means it is adaptable to varying processing and bandwidth conditions, resulting in a better experience for our User, You! If you’re interested in learning more about WebM take a look at the documentation on the WebM site here.

If you see issues with a video in your Presentation, and the problematic video(s) are not WebM encoded, please convert to WebM before contacting Support.
