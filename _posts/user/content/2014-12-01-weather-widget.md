##What it does
The Weather Widget puts images and text describing the current weather conditions and/or the 3-day weather forecast onto your display, for the address or geographical location that you specify in the settings. 

##How to add it to a presentation
To put this widget on a display:

1. In the placeholder's Properties window, click the Add link and select Content to open the Rise Vision store.  
2. Click the widget named Weather. This takes you to the product’s description and pricing information.  
3. Click the Add button to add it to your playlist.  This closes the store window and returns you to the Placeholder window, where Weather Widget now appears in the placeholder's playlist.

##How to configure it
To configure this widget, click the Configure link.  If this is the only item in the placeholder's playlist, the Configure link is in the Settings area at the bottom of the Placeholder window, right below the playlist. If there are multiple items in the playlist, clicking the name of this widget opens an Item window and the Configure link is in the Settings area of that window.

Clicking the Configure link opens a Weather Settings window, in which you can configure the following settings:

#####Layout
In this field, you can select your preferred layout:
- Current: shows only the current conditions.
- 3-Day Forecast: shows the weather forecast for today and the next two days.
- Current with 3-Day Forecast: shows both of the above layouts together.
- Layout URL: if you prefer to use a custom layout instead, type its URL here.

The images shown for each of these options represent how they will appear in either landscape or portrait arrangements on your display.

#####Font Style, Size, Variants and Color choices for 'Current Temperature', 'Forecast Temperature', 'Forecast Day', 'Address' & 'Humidity and Wind'
In these fields you can set the appearance of the font for the text that displays this widget's data. 
- Font (style): select a font from the drop-down list or from the Fonts window that opens when you select More Fonts.  Alternatively, you can select 'Use Custom Font' and specify the URL of a web font in the field that appears below.
- Font Size: select a font size (in pixels) from choices in the drop-down list.
- Font Variants: select Bold and/or Italic if desired.
- Font Color: specify the font color either by entering an rgba value or a HEX value, or by clicking on a desired color and opacity from the color-picker window that appears when you click on this field.

For each type of data that you can configure in this window, sample text showing the results of your choices appears in the grey box below each section.

#####Address
In this field, specify the geographical location for which the weather data will be shown. There are three options:
- Geolocation: shows the weather for the location indicated by the IP geolocation data obtained from your display
- Display Address: shows the weather for the address set on the display’s settings page (if you unchecked the Use Company Address box and entered a specific address for that display).
- Custom Address: shows the weather for a custom address that you specify in the Your Custom Address field that appears below. You can enter a full mailing address, or just a city name, or just a zip code (USA) or a postal code (Canada).

#####Address Description
In this field you can specify whether and how you want the location of the weather to be shown. Choices are:
- None: no location name is shown.
- From Service: the name of the location is supplied by the widget.
- Custom Description: type the location name into the Your Custom Description field that appears below.

#####Show Humidity and Wind
Check the checkbox in this field if you want to include humidity and wind data in your display. If you check this box, you can also select your preferred wind speed units (kilometers or miles per hour) in the drop-down field that appears below.

#####Unit
In this field you can select whether you want the temperature data to be shown in Celsius or Fahrenheit units.

#####Background Color
In this field you can specify the widget's background color.  Enter an rgba value, a HEX value, or select a color and an opacity by clicking on them from the color-picker window that appears when you click on this field.
