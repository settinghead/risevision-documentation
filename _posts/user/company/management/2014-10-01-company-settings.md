**Name / Street / Unit /City / Country / State/Province/Region / Postal Code / Time Zone / Telephone / Fax:**  Enter the details of your company’s name, location and contact information.  This is the address used by some widgets to drive location-specific content to your presentation.
 
**Status:**  Normally shows as Active, but you can change a sub-company’s status to Inactive if desired.  If set to Inactive, users cannot log in and displays show only demonstration content.  The date and time that the company was first added to the platform is shown to the right of the Status field.
 
**Authentication Key:**  This is the key used by applications and widgets to access your company’s data, and by network administrators to move a sub-company from one parent company to another.  It should be kept confidential.  If you think it has been compromised, click the Reset link (to the right of the key) to generate a new one.  This will cause your current widgets to stop reporting data to your company, until you update them with the new key.
 
**Claim ID:**  This is the key used by the Rise Vision Player to identify your company and automatically register displays to it.
 
**Monitoring Emails:**  Enter the email address to which notification emails should be sent from any display that is set up to be monitored (i.e., to alert you when it fails or recovers).
 
**Allow Alerts:**  Click this checkbox if you want to allow alerts (warning messages) to be sent to your company’s displays from a Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) compliant service.  Clicking this box will reveal a new Acceptance field, with terms which must be read and agreed to by clicking the new checkbox to the left of the terms.
 
**Social Connections:**  To enable the adding of Twitter or Foursquare content to your presentations, click Add and choose the type of connection you want to make.  A separate tab opens in your browser prompting you to log in to the service, or, if you’re already logged in, to authorize the Rise Vision Application to access your Twitter or Foursquare account.  Once you authorize it, the new connection will be listed in this field, and a unique authentication token is generated for the social connection-related widgets that you use in your presentations.
 
**Profile:**  This area contains some questions about your intended use of the Rise Vision platform.  Answering them helps us to understand what types of companies use the platform, and for what purposes.
 
Once you’ve completed all of the fields on the company settings page, be sure to click the Save button at the top right corner of the page.  The date or time of the last save, and the username of the person who saved it, is shown above the button.
