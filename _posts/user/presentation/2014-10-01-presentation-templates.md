One of the quickest ways to prepare content for your display is to start with a pre-designed presentation template, and then modify it in the presentation editor with your own messages, images and branding. .
 
###What are Presentation Templates?
A presentation template is a pre-built layout of content designed for display on a digital sign.  Each template has a predefined size, look and arrangement of content items.  Templates can provide you with a quick starting point for creating a presentation of your own, because the basic setup is already done, and you can modify all of its properties and pieces to suit your own communication needs and aesthetic preferences. 

###Create a Presentation from a Template
1. Click the Presentations link at the top of the Rise Vision page, and then click the Add from Template button in the top right corner.  A list of all available presentation templates will appear.
2. Preview any template by clicking the Preview link next to the name of the template.  This opens the preview in a new browser tab, which you can close once you’ve viewed it.
3. To choose a template, click the Select link next to its name.  This opens a copy of the template in the presentation editor, allowing you to change its settings, modify its layout, and save it to your company’s own list of presentations.
4. To change its name and other settings, click on the Presentations Settings icon (the gear icon in the top right corner).  This opens the Presentations Settings window where you can rename the presentation, change its resolution, specify a background image or color, make it a template for your sub-companies (see below), hide or show the mouse pointer, name the placeholder that indicates when the presentation is finished, and copy the Presentation ID (which is needed to embed this presentation into another presentation).  Then click the Okay button to save the settings changes you just made.
5. Next, modify the layout in the presentation editor by replacing any parts of the pre-designed content with your own.  See “Creating a Presentation” below for instructions on how to work with the layout’s content placeholders.
6. Finally, save your renamed and modified presentation by clicking the Save icon (the floppy disk icon in the top right corner).  Doing so adds your new layout to your company’s list of presentations.  Click the Presentations link in the top menu bar to see your newly-modified and renamed template in your list of presentations.
 
###Make a Presentation Template for your Sub-Companies
1. To change a standard presentation template into a custom template that you share with your clients (sub-companies), follow the steps above to create a presentation from a template, but do Step 5 before Step 4.  In other words, make all your desired changes first, before designating it as a template in the settings window.  
2. Once you have modified the presentation to your liking, go to the Presentations Settings window (click the gear icon in the top right corner) and check the Template checkbox to make it a template, and then press Okay.  Save the presentation by clicking the Save (floppy disk) icon, and it will now appear in the list of presentation templates for all of your sub-companies.
