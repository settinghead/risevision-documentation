1. Click the Settings link at the top of any Rise Vision page, and on the Settings page, click the checkbox in the Allow Alerts field.  This is a global setting which allows alerts for your company.  Checking this field reveals several new fields underneath.

Click the Change link to open a Select Presentation window showing a list of all of your presentations.  Click the Select link beside the name of the presentation that you wish to use for alerts.

	If you wish to use it, an pre-built Alert Presentation template is available from the Presentations page.

Then return to this Presentation field on the Settings page and follow the instructions in the previous paragraph to select your copy of “Alert Presentation”.

This opens a Distribution window with a list of your displays.  Click the checkbox beside the name of each display that you wish to select, and then click the Save button.  
3. In the Default Expiry field, specify the length of time (in minutes) that the alert will be shown if the Expiration Date/Time of the alert has not been specified by the alert provider.
