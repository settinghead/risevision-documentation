As a cloud-based platform, Rise Vision requires that all of your presentations’ media content – such as your photos, background images and video files – be stored (hosted) on a server somewhere, so they can be retrieved and shown in your presentation. 
 
You have three choices for storing your content: you can host it on your own server (if you have one), on a third-party server (a commercial cloud storage service), or on the Rise Vision server.  Storage is the premium feature that lets you host your digital signage content directly on the Rise Vision server.  Think of it as our built-in media library for more convenient uploading, downloading and hosting of all of your signs’ visual assets.
